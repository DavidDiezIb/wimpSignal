# wimpSignal
Code to generate WIMP rates in different materials and compute the sensitivity curve of a direct detection experiment using the Poisson method. Only spin independet elastic interaction included. 

In WimpRate.py all needed functions to compute signal and sensitivity. Other files: Pyhon notebooks to show results.

This code was written for TREX-DM experiment. The repository of J. Aalbers https://github.com/JelleAalbers/wimprates, with similar purpose, was extremely useful an the main source of verification for this code.
