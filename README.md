# wimpSignal
Code to generate WIMP rates in different materials and compute the sensitivity curve of a direct detection experiment using the Poisson method. Only spin independet elastic interaction included. 

In WimpRate.py all needed functions to compute signal and sensitivity. Other files: Pyhon notebooks to show results.
